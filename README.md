# UFO Analysis

## Overview

In order to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings, I refactored the code to allow users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, table filters for the city, state, country, and shape were added.

## Results :alien:

The new webpage is more user friendly and it allows users to filter UFO sightings by date, city, state, country, and shape. Having these additional filters tailor the webpage to the interest of the users at a more granular level. When a user navigates to the webpage, the user will simply have to scroll down to see the full UFO sightings data. If the user wants more specific data, they could follow the following steps:

* User inputs a filter (e.g. 'Enter State' = fl); The webpage automatically updates to filter by that input.

* User inputs a second filter (e.g 'Enter Shape' = fireball); The webpage automatically updates with this second filter and retaining the initial filter.

## Summary

Even though we have made this webpage more user friendly with the use of multiple filters, one drawback is that the user may not know exactly what they are looking for in order to come up with a filter to use. In essence, the new webpage currently helps those users who already know exactly what they are looking for.

A couple of recommendations for further development that I would suggest is that we could add a sorting feature to the table data for the users to be able to sort by date or duration, for example. In addition, we could add a Search Engine feature where the user can search for a specific sighting they have knowledge of. These two features will further enhance our webpage!
